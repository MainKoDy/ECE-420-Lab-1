Overview:
    This program calculates the product between 2 square matrices. It includes both a program to generate two matrices, and a program to compute the product.

-----
    Data generation program:
    matrixgen.c      source file for the input data generation program, given from the development kit for lab 1 in eclass.

-----
    Important functions:
    timer.h          macro definition for time measurement, given from the development kit for lab 1 in eclass
    lab1_IO.h        header for the lab1_IO.c, need to be included to call the IOs directly from lab1_IO.c. Given from the development kit for lab 1 in eclass
    lab1_IO.c        source file for the IO functions, need to be referred in the compiler line if the functions are called in the program. Given from the development kit for lab 1 in eclass
	
----
    Matrix multiplication program:
    matrix_mult_pth.c   file which includes the program to calculate the resulting matrix between the product of 2 square matrices.

    Makefile            makefile for the program. Includes instructions to create the executables of both the matrix generation program, and the matrix multiplication program.
